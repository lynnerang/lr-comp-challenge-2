## General Info

<h4 align="middle">A project for practicing creating a UI from a flat mock using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JS for Turing's Front-End Engineering course, Module 1.</h4>


## Motivation

Static Comp #2 was a project I was assigned as a Mod 1 student at Turing.  We were given a flat mock without styling details (images, icons, hex codes) to reproduce from scratch in code.  This was primarily working with HTML and CSS.  Here's the comp we were given:
